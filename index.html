        <p><em>BrewCrate brings you Homebrew as a Service. Everything you need to brew your own beer month after month.</em></p>

<h1>
<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h1>

<p>Interest in craft beer and homebrew is at an all-time high. New breweries are opening at a rate of over 1 per day in the US, but very few would-be homebrewers make it past the first batch. The culprits: <strong>bad kit instructions, low-quality ingredients</strong>, and an assumption that new brewers know where to find the information they lack. The customer is there, but the product is not. Homebrewing provides a cheap and fun way to socialize, so naturally we wanted a simple way to enjoy this hobby without the frustration of reinventing the wheel.</p>

<p>We recognize that subscription services get people in the door and retain users better than traditional ecommerce services. As a result, we are able to market a fantastic experience and build a cohesive community for our users through our product. </p>

<h1>
<a name="the-product" class="anchor" href="#the-product"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Product</h1>

<p>We provide innovative, tested recipes with thorough instructions delivered to your door once a month. For $20 you get all the ingredients necessary to brew a 12-pack of beer, and we also offer a one-time equpiment kit for first-timers, complete with all the supplies required to get started.</p>

<p>Unlike existing offerings, we make sure you're always brewing by providing a variety of high quality, tested recipes and delivering them monthly so you never run out. And rather than focusing on brewers we are focusing on the entire DIY crowd, from hardware hackers to knitters to foodies to LARPers to bored stay-at-home parents. However, we've been told many times that our kits are solid enough to appeal to expert brewers looking for new recipes. <strong>If you like making things, you'll love BrewCrate.</strong></p>

<p>While our initial offering is a single kit, we are quickly adding new kit tracks to teach technique and larger kits for those who feel confident in their skills. Additionally, we are building a system for subscribers to decide the style, recipe, and name of each kit in the future, similar to the way <a href="http://www.threadless.com">Threadless</a> allows users to vote on T-shirt designs. However, our real killer feature is a new take on the e-commerce experience: we are building an end-to-end kit builder that selects ingredients based on your intended brew and makes ordering as simple as searching on Google. Buying a kit this way is unprecedented and empowers the brewer to use their creativity to experiment with new ideas without needing a formal education in the science of brewing.</p>

<a name="history" class="anchor" href="#history"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/samuel-gimbel/3a/422/b32">Sam Gimbel</a> started in tech as a QA Engineer at the now defunct Hashable. He started in beer at 21 by brewing very unsuccessfully at first due to a lack of resources. It was discouraging, but he loved it enough to continue. In late 2012 while working at <a href="http://www.dramafever.com">DramaFever</a> as a Product Manager, Sam decided that no one should have to deal with the friction of getting started with a hobby, and the seed was planted.</p>

<p>BrewCrate rose out of an observation that subscription services <strong>get people in the door</strong> and provide a stickier experience than e-commerce by itself. By recognizing the potential for community and user interaction we have elevated the experience from <a href="http://brooklynbrewshop.com/store-1">just OK</a> to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/pgioj54z0xgbeik/Screenshot%202013-10-23%2008.58.37.png">outstanding</a>.</p>

<p>This experience is only possible due to Sam's QA/Product experience and the luck of finding <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/michael-porter/46/444/3a3">Michael Porter</a>, whose development experience and five years of brew expertise are crucial to validating the BrewCrate assumption that homebrewing can be a modern and forward-thinking hobby.</p>

<p>The last piece of the pie was finding a logistics expert. If Sam and Mike are the one-two tech and product punch, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=63225421">Daniel Earle</a> is the knockout blow that allowed BrewCrate to exist as a product at all. By recognizing the fragility of the raw ingredients and the need for solid relationships with small suppliers worldwide Dan has developed a supply line strategy that manages to get all components together the day before the kits are built and shipped, ensuring your experience is as fresh as possible.</p>

<p>Beginning at launch in mid November we expect to bring you innovation after innovation, starting with our simple-as-possible 1 gallon kits and quickly expanding into larger scale, a la carte options, and interactive community experiences. We believe that we can grow a community as we grow our product, providing our users with new products and features as their needs evolve. The BrewCrate family is just being established, but we expect it to grow quickly!</p>
