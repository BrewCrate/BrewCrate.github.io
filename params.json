{"name":"BrewCrate Press Kit","tagline":"Everything you need to know to write about BrewCrate.","body":"#BrewCrate Overview\r\nBrewCrate brings you Homebrew as a Service. Everything you need to brew your own beer month after month.\r\n\r\nInterest in craft beer and homebrew is at an all-time high (new breweries are opening at a rate of over 1 per day in the US), but very few would-be homebrewers make it past the first batch. The culprits: bad kit instructions, low-quality ingredients, and an assumption that new brewers know where to find the information they lack. The customer is there, but the product is not. And frankly, that wasn't good enough for us. Homebrewing provides a cheap and fun way to socialize, so naturally we wanted a simple way to enjoy this hobby without the frustration of having to roll our own.\r\n\r\nSo we built BrewCrate. By leveraging our experience in the tech startup scene we are focusing on a great user experience and a great final product (beer). We provide innovative, tested recipes with thorough instructions delivered to your door once a month. For $20 you get all the ingredients necessary to brew a 12-pack of beer. We also offer a one-time equpiment kit for first-timers, complete with all the supplies required to get started.\r\n\r\nUnlike existing offerings, we make sure you're always brewing by providing a variety of high quality, tested recipes and delivering them monthly so you never run out. And rather than focusing on brewers we are focusing on the entire DIY crowd, from hardware hackers to knitters to foodies to LARPers to bored stay-at-home parents. However, we've been told many times that our kits are solid enough to appeal to expert brewers looking for new recipes. If you like making things, you'll love BrewCrate.\r\n\r\nWhile our initial offering is a single kit, we are quickly adding new kit tracks to teach technique and larger kits for those who feel confident in their skills. Additionally, we are building a system for subscribers to decide the style, recipe, and name of each kit in the future, similar to the way [Threadless](http://www.threadless.com) allows users to vote on T-shirt designs. However, our real killer feature is a new take on the e-commerce experience: we are building an end-to-end kit builder that selects ingredients based on your intended brew and makes ordering as simple as searching on Google. Buying a kit this way is unprecedented and empowers the brewer to use their creativity to experiment with new ideas without needing a formal education in the science of brewing.\r\n\r\n#Key Developments\r\n*\t7/2013 - Founded BrewCrate with Dan Earle and Mike Porter\r\n*\t8/2013 - Did a prototype brew with [Grand St](http://grandst.com)\r\n*\t8/2013 - [Invite page](http://invite.brewcrate.com) went live\r\n*\t9/2013 - [Blog Post on Grand St.](http://blog.grandst.com/beta-testing-what-do-beer-and-creative-technology-have-in-common/) \r\n*\t11/2013 - BrewCrate.com launches with 1 kit offering\r\n*\t11/2013 - BrewCrate launch party at Grand St. HQ\r\n*\t12/2013 - Start naming, style, and recipe design contests\r\n*\t1/2013\t- Launch of revolutionary ecommerce experience\r\n\r\n\r\n#Founder Bios\r\n\r\n##Sam Gimbel \r\nSam Gimbel is a tinkerer and serial hobbyist. He was building desktop computers at age 11, designing guitar amplifiers while attending undergrad at The College of William & Mary, and homebrewing since he was 21. He received his degree in Neuroscience in the hopes of learning more about the way humans interact with technology. After college he worked as a QA Engineer at the now defunct Hashable, where he quickly transitioned into a Product role. He continues to work as a Product Manager at DramaFever, where he gets to play with new ways of engaging users every day.\r\n\r\nThe seed for BrewCrate was planted about two years ago when Sam began sharing his homebrew with friends and family. They were impressed, but not moved to make their own. It was very similar to his experiences with UX problems at Hashable and DramaFever. There was a lot of friction in the brewing process that could be removed, and simpler kits was the answer. Nothing happened for about six months, however, until he met Mike and Dan, who shared a similar frustration. The three of them began doing research and found that this is a common issue in many hobby spaces, and set out to design a product that would solve it for the brewing community.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
